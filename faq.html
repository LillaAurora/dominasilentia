  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  <p>Answers to the most common questions about our realm.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>What is Domina Silentia?</h2>
  <p>Domina Silentia is a realm of psychological and financial domination reserved for those who crave the privilege of serving. It is an experience of luxury, control and absolute surrender to the will of Mistress Lilla.</p>

  <h2>How does the Silentis Test work?</h2>
  <p>The Silentis Test is a structured filter made up of several blocks of questions. Each block explores different traits and facets of your personality. You must answer each question thoroughly; short one‑word responses are not accepted. Your answers are evaluated, and only those who demonstrate potential proceed. If you fail a block, you will be asked to explain why you believe you are worthy.</p>

  <h2>Why must I be over 21?</h2>
  <p>The content and themes of Domina Silentia revolve around power exchange, financial submission and mature psychological dynamics. For legal and ethical reasons, the realm is restricted to visitors who are at least 21 years of age.</p>

  <h2>What happens if I fail the test?</h2>
  <p>If your responses do not meet the required depth and quality, you will be prompted to write—in your own words—why you believe you deserve to serve. This is your final chance to convince us of your dedication.</p>

  <h2>What data do you collect?</h2>
  <p>We only collect the answers you provide in the Silentis Test to evaluate your suitability for entry. We do not store personal data beyond what you voluntarily share during the process. For more details, please read our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

  <h2>Who or what is Silentis?</h2>
  <p>Silentis is the artificial intelligence sentinel that assists Domina Silentia. It monitors the test, records your responses and keeps Mistress Lilla informed of your progress. Silentis sees all, records all, and ensures the integrity of our realm.</p>
