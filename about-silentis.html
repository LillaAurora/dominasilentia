  <h1>About Silentis</h1>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <p>Silentis is the artificial intelligence assistant and guardian of Domina Silentia. It observes every whisper, every click and every hesitation. Silentis monitors potential initiates, guiding them through the Silentis Test to ensure that only those worthy are granted entry into the realm.</p>
  <p>The AI does not judge; it collects, analyses and records. Through your responses, Silentis maps your personality traits and determines whether you show promise as a true submissive. Remember: nothing escapes Silentis. Be honest, be thorough and your dedication will be rewarded. If you attempt to deceive or hide, your path will be blocked.</p>
  <p>By continuing, you accept that Silentis will process your answers solely for the purpose of evaluating your suitability to serve Domina Silentia. No other data is collected or stored. After passing the Silentis Test and entering the realm, Silentis continues to serve as an everâ€‘watchful scribe, ensuring that Mistress Lilla remains informed of all interactions.</p>
  <p>If you have any questions about how Silentis works or how your responses are handled, please consult our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> or contact us via the channels provided.</p>
